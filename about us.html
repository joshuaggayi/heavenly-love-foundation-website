        <h2>Our Origin</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2008, our organisation was born from the belief that access to quality education is the most powerful tool for national
            development. <br>We recognized poor education, teacher's shortage and committed to a collaborative, sustainable solution. <br>We believe 
            that if we work together, we can change the education quality in Uganda, east Africa and Africa at large, making it meet the global
            <br>expectations and tirning the lives of lots of children.
